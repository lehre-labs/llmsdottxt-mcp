# Release

Use when the user says `/release`, "cut a release", "tag a version", or asks to publish a new version.

## Preconditions

- Requires `git` and authenticated `gh` CLI.
- Release from `main` only.
- Do not create tags or GitHub releases without explicit user confirmation.
- Read `docs/release-checklist.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `pyproject.toml` before changing anything.

## Workflow

1. Inspect state:
   - `git status --short`
   - `git branch --show-current`
   - `git fetch origin main --tags`
   - `git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline`
   - `gh auth status`
2. Block if not on `main`, dirty without confirmed release edits, behind `origin/main`, or missing `gh` auth.
3. Determine the target version from the requested bump, `pyproject.toml`, existing tags, and unreleased commits.
4. Update `CHANGELOG.md` in the changesets format defined by the `changelog` skill: group entries as Major, Minor, or Patch with a commit hash per entry.
5. If the version changes, update project version metadata using the repo's configured tooling or the smallest direct edit.
6. Run the release checklist checks that fit the changed surface. Do not skip failed checks silently.
7. Commit release prep with `chore(release): vX.Y.Z` after confirmation.
8. Create an annotated tag: `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "vX.Y.Z"`.
9. Push the commit and tag only after confirmation:
   - `git push origin main`
   - `git push origin vX.Y.Z`
10. Create the GitHub release with `gh release create vX.Y.Z --title "vX.Y.Z" --notes-file <notes>`.

## Changelog Rules

- Maintain `CHANGELOG.md` in the changesets format defined by the `changelog` skill: `## <version>` headers with `### Major Changes`, `### Minor Changes`, and `### Patch Changes`, one `` `hash` Thanks @author! — … `` bullet per change.
- Map breaking changes to Major, new features to Minor, and fixes/docs/refactors to Patch.
- Keep `CHANGELOG.md` compact and reverse chronological.
- Describe user-visible changes, not implementation trivia.
- Keep examples generic; never include live private URLs, fetched third-party docs, or tokens.

## Blockers

Block release when checks fail, version/tag already exists, release notes are unclear, private data appears in docs/examples, PyPI release settings are not confirmed, or repository settings still need human action.
